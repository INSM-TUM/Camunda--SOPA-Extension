## About the Demo Dataset

The provided process model describes a logistics process and was used for the evaluation of the implemented software extension. As it offers several possible paths to walk through and represents a simple, but realistic scenario, it serves as a good demo case. You can import it into the modified Camunda Process Engine and see how you are able to provide abstract and concrete cost drivers with their respective parameters for each process activity.

## LCA Data

The data with its product system for the openLCA database which was taken from the ICPM-Demo, can be found here: https://github.com/INSM-TUM/SimuBridge--SOPA-Extension/tree/main/demo/LCA. It is based on the European reference Life Cycle Database of the Joint Research Center ([see here](https://eplca.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ELCD3/)). The dataset, taken from [openLCA](https://nexus.openlca.org/database/ELCD) can be used free of charge and distributed to third parties. It is important to notice that the software extension expects the data and modelled product systems to be structured in that specific format, in case you want to test it with different data for example.
